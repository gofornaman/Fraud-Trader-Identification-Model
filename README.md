# Fraud-Trader-Identification-Model

## Who is a Trader or a Bulk Buyer?
Trader is someone who purchases goods at discounted rate and then sells them offline. 

## Why to track Traders?
This kind of fradulent activity causes the products to go out of stock before legitimate customers can make a purchase

## How to track them?

Based on the problem statement, we can hypothesize few possible feature with respect to our target feature (Trader or Legitimate customer).

- Number of Orders made by the customer
- Is the first order, a bulk orders?
- Is the user_name linked to other user_names? (For eg - john,john1,john2,john3 might be related). This can be achieved using Supervised Fuzzy Clustering
- Number of phone numbers linked to the user_name
- Number of address linked to the user_name
- Tendency of the user to only buy discounted products

## Feature Extraction & Modeling

Naive Bayes is used for Modeling & Pickle file is stored.

## Deploying the Model
